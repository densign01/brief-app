# Continuity Ledger: Brief TestFlight Prep
Updated: 2025-12-31

## Goal
Streamline the Brief project and prepare iOS/macOS app for TestFlight submission.

## Constraints

- `brief-api/src/index.js` - Cloudflare Workers API

## Backlog

### ✅ FIXED: Missing Article Metadata from App Shares
- When sharing from NYT app, title and publication are not extracted
- **Fix:** Share extension now fetches page and extracts og:title/twitter:title/<title>
- Commit: `64fc202`

### ✅ FIXED: Hide API Endpoint from Settings
- API Endpoint field is exposed in Settings UI (unnecessary for end users)
- **Fix:** Removed from UI, keeps hardcoded default
- Commit: `64fc202`

### ✅ FIXED: Brief Not Visible in Share Sheet from Certain Apps
- Brief doesn't appear in share sheet when sharing from NYT app (works from Safari/NYT.com)
- **Fix:** Added NSExtensionActivationSupportsText and NSExtensionActivationSupportsAttachmentsWithMaxCount
- Commit: `500c662`

### ✅ FIXED: Paywall Bypass for AI Summaries  
- Paywalled content (e.g., NYT) returns "Article content was behind a paywall - no summary available"
- **Fix:** Now uses generateTitleBasedSummary() to create AI-inferred summary from title
- **Enhancement:** Summaries now labeled "AI-generated from title - full article not accessible"
- Deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- Commit: `500c662`, `b226e67`

### ✅ FIXED: New App Icon Design

- Commit: `b226e67`

### ✅ FIXED: X.com/Twitter URL Titles
- X/Twitter returned "JavaScript is not available" as title
- **Fix:** Extract @username from URL, display as "Post by @username on X"
- Filter out other bad titles from JS-heavy sites
- Commit: `b226e67`

### ✅ FIXED: macOS Safari Share Extension URL Not Extracted
- Share extension was sending empty URL from Safari
- **Fix:** Added multiple fallback extraction methods (userInfo, attributedContentText, fileURL type)
- Commit: `2f0388a`

### ✅ ADDED: Keyboard Shortcuts for macOS
- ⌘+Return to send
- Escape to cancel
- Hint text showing keyboard shortcut
- Commit: `1faa623`

### ✅ SWITCHED: AI Provider to Gemini 2.5 Flash (2024-12-28)
- Migrated from OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Updated `@ai-sdk/openai` → `@ai-sdk/google` v3.0.1 in package.json
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Pricing: $0.30/1M input, $2.50/1M output
- Added `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to Cloudflare secrets
- Updated UI text from "Claude" to "Gemini"
- Made share sheet more compact (removed scroll)
- Can remove `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from Cloudflare
- Commit: `9126024`

### ✅ FIXED: AI Summary Not Generating (2025-12-29)
- Root cause: AI SDK v5 incompatible with Gemini 2.5 (v3 spec not supported)
- Secondary issue: False paywall detection ("subscribe" matching newsletter buttons)
- **Fix:** Switched from AI SDK to direct Gemini 2.0 Flash API calls
- **Fix:** Simplified paywall detection to content length only (< 500 chars)
- **Fix:** Added markdown-to-HTML conversion for email formatting
- Commit: `8c36103`

### ✅ FIXED: Restore AI Summary Toggle in Share Sheet (2025-12-29)
- Toggle and length picker were implemented but not rendered
- **Fix:** Added `aiSummarySection` to ShareView body
- Commit: pending user build verification

### ✅ FIXED: Instagram Sharing HTML Entity Decoding (2025-12-30)
- Instagram shares text with HTML-encoded entities (`&quot;`, `&#x201c;`, etc.)
- Title displayed raw without decoding, showing garbage characters
- **Fix:** Added `htmlDecoded` String extension using `NSAttributedString` HTML parser
- Applied to both iOS and macOS share extensions
- Decodes titles from: plain text, property list, og:title, twitter:title, `<title>` tag
- Commit: pending

### ✅ FIXED: Resend Domain Verification for External Testers (2025-12-31)
- Registered `send-brief.com` domain via Cloudflare
- Verified domain with Resend
- Updated API `from` address: `onboarding@resend.dev` → `brief@send-brief.com`
- Deployed to Cloudflare Workers

### ✅ ADDED: 3-Step Onboarding Flow (2025-12-31)
- Step 1: Email entry with validation (saves to UserPreferences)
- Step 2: Enable extension instructions with setup guide link
- Step 3: Animated share demo showing Safari → Share → Brief → Email
- Platform-specific: iOS uses swipe TabView, macOS uses button navigation
- Realistic mocks: Safari browser, share sheet with app icons, loading spinner
- Branch: `feature/onboarding-flow` merged to main
- Commit: `b0393da`

### ✅ ADDED: Tweet Content Extraction via oEmbed (2025-12-29)
- X/Twitter shares were showing AI-generated guesses instead of actual tweet text
- **Fix:** Added `fetchTweetContent()` using Twitter's free oEmbed API
- Extracts: author name, handle, actual tweet text
- Display: Tweet styled with Twitter-blue left border, proper attribution
- Skips AI summary for tweets (actual content is better)
- Detection now runs unconditionally (not just when title is missing)
- Deployed to Cloudflare Workers

### Feature: Links Sent History
- Add ability to see previously sent links
- Track what articles have been captured
- Would require backend storage or local persistence
- Consider sync across devices

### Exploration: Infrastructure Evaluation
- Evaluate alternatives to current Cloudflare Workers + Resend setup
- Firebase could provide:
  - Authentication
  - Firestore for history/sync
  - Cloud Functions for API
  - Push notifications
- Compare cost, complexity, and feature tradeoffs
